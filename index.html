            <div class="interviewed"><p>Hey Calvin!  I attended Thursday night's session last week and really enjoyed the discussion about jobs in IT that were not necessarily being a developer.</p></div>

            <div class="interviewer"><p>HI PATRICK.   THANKS FOR THAT! THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES IN IT, DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOCUS, BIG AND SMALL. SAY YES TO ANYTHING YOU HEAR ABOUT OR GET A CHANCE TO LEARN.</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Thanks.  I have a bit of experience in the programming and applications development, but had a severe TBI 10 years ago.  This resulted in two major changes that have made interviewing a struggle.
            
            </br></br>First, my speech patterns have changed drastically and are now literal and direct, meaning that I come off as a know-it-all, even though I have no intention to.  At work, I often started conversations with new peoples with "Hi, I'm Patrick.  I am looking forward to working with you on X and want to let you know that I had a brain injury some time ago that impacts the way I speak.  If I come across as thinking my ideas are best, or as closed minded, please know that I do not mean to."   I would usually have another person who would aid in the first-time meetings with VPs and the like to smooth out the initial engagement.  </br></br>
            Once someone knew me, they would laugh the tone deafness and apparent haughtiness off and defend me to new people saying things like "Oh thatâ€™s just Patrick and the way he talks, you'll get used to it.  He is really a great guy.  He is never too busy to help you out and is really patient." - actual quote  </br></br>
            The second part of what makes interviews are a struggle is my limited ability to recall things without cuing.  If an interviewer asks "tell me about a time when", I am going tell them about the last thing that I did that remotely relates (think like a LILO process, my mind will have no clue and scramble using the words in the question to try to find something related).  </br>
        </br>Up until I was laid off last June, for the first time in my life, I had always been headhunted (or referred) for my next position, so had someone to bridge the gap.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>HOW ARE YOU WITH HEADS-DOWN PROGRAMMING, WHERE YOU HAVE A CLEAR GOAL, REFERENCE MATERIALS ON HAND, AND IDES THAT HELP WITH SYNTAX AND TYPE CHECKING?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I would imagine I would be fine in that setting. </br>
            </br>A lot of my previous development experience has been in prototyping new applications (in a time before rapid prototyping tools- building out the actual tool at small scale).  All development activities were done in addition to my normal duties â€“ when I saw an opportunity to make things better through automation and the like.    </br>
            </br>I did this as part of creating the business case for a new solutions when I worked for ZirMed (ZirMed University).  I also did the use case, business requirements, project plans, etc.  </br>
            </br>In a time before livestreaming, I build a "virtual conferencing platform" on .net by cobbling together desperate solutions using APIs (a virtual conferencing platform in 2010 that allowed 700 users to connect and attend 25 live sessions- and was not only revenue neutral, but generated 25K in revenue)</br>
            </br>I ran education technologies for two multi-million dollar healthcare organizations and managed their support teams (that oversaw over 20,000 users each company)</br>
            </br>I have created data processing tools that combined data dumps from CMS and SHP data into a visual format for our Admins to be able to quickly process the data.</br>
            </br>I helped integrate a decision tree into that solutions so the building administrators could identify and address problems before they became major areas of concern.  This project saved\allowed us to claw back around 1.3 million in fees and penalties from CMS.</br>
            </br>One concern I have is that all of my programming has been lone wolf, even though I was part of an Agile team at ZirMed, it was as the user experience/marketing guy, not a dev.</br>
            </br>These positions were all in the time after I was in the car accident.  The memory issues don't come into play as much in the day to day (although they do to a much lesser extent) they are more in the "tell me about a time when" nature of an interview.</p>
        </div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>YOU HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE; YOU SHOULD BE MENTORING ME!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Anything I can do to help you I will.  I am always available if my experience is able to be used.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>ONE THING YOU MAY KNOW, I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT, IS THAT COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DISSATISFIED WITH THE WAY THEY HAVE ASSESSED CANDIDATES</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that most are still in the old mode</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>...AND SOME HAVE TURNED TO THIS KIND OF MODEL: "HERE IS A SMALL PROJECT, MAY TAKE YOU A WEEKEND..."  "DO THE PROJECT AND COME BACK TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT" HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED THIS?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I have not seen that, but would love that kind of challenge.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>IF YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LONE WOLF WORK, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN WORKING REMOTE?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I am not opposed to it.  I am doing the odd consulting job now.  But making ends meet is more than challenging... like not happening.  I had 13 months salary saved, but have spent all but 1.5 months at this point.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN IT? AND IF SO, WHAT FOCUS IN IT?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I have no real preference (another issue from the frontal lobe damage).  I do what is needed and get fulfillment out of accomplishing the goal and serving the organization.  I always end up doing a lot of things outside of what I was hired to do.  Mostly because I end up automating the functions I was hired to do, I naturally gravitate toward needs analysis.  I define the problem, identify key players and data sources, investigate the root cause, identify possible solutions, meet with stakeholders to decide on a course of action, and if needed create the solution.  If that solution involves programming, I create the use case scenarios, define the requirements, and build out a testable prototype solution.  I have done this in three different industries - software development, higher education, and healthcare.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>HAVE YOU BEEN ATTENDING LOCAL MEETUPS? DO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND COMPANIES AND ISSUES AROUND TOWN?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I have attended some, but none have had much of anyone but code Louisville students</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>CODE LOUISVILLE HAS BECOME A SORT OF LOCAL MAFIA, SO I'VE HEARD!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Yeah.  If only someone would make me an offer I can't refuse ðŸ˜Š</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>HAVE YOU CONSIDERED "NEGOTIATING" HOW AN INTERVIEW MIGHT GO? LIKE THIS:  "I CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A WRITTEN FORMAT, OR WORK ON A SMALL PROJECT OVER A WEEKEND"  DO YOU THINK HIRING MANAGERS WOULD BE THAT FLEXIBLE?  </p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I don't know.  I am hesitant to expose my disability going in, as even though they are supposed to make accommodation, it would still look weird being the only one who did theirs in such a radically different format.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>SO FIRST OF ALL, IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO TRY THAT ROUTE, IF IT IS POSSIBLE...</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>It is worth a shot.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>SECOND, PEOPLE WITH YOUR SKILLS ARE IN DEMAND</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Only if I can get in front of people, and they can get past my quirks</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>IF I WERE A HIRING MANAGER, AND HAD POSITIONS TO FILL, I MIGHT CONSIDER TALKING WITH YOU AND ACCOMMODATING YOU  SO DO YOU HAVE A "RINGABLE NETWORK" (A TERM I JUST NOW MADE UP), PEOPLE TO WHOM YOU CAN LAUNCH AN IDEA?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I don't follow</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE IN THE INDUSTRY, FORMER COWORKERS, PEOPLE YOU HAVE RECENTLY MET..  ...AND SAID TO THEM "HERE ARE MY QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, I'M LOOKING FOR WORK, HERE'S WHAT I NEED..."</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Not really, not in a way that would be beneficial, as they were non-IT for the most part, or have moved across the country career goals.  I approached a number of people from my past, but when people know you are in need and they don't have anything to offer it makes the relationship little weird.   Most of my contacts are in marketing, finance, and nursing or education.  </p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>HAVE YOU TALKED TO CODE LOUISVILLE STAFF, ESPECIALLY SHANNON, ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND TBI?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I have not</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>PLEASE DO!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>You are the first person I have mentioned it to in a long time.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>PLEASE DO ENLIST SHANNON TO YOUR AID, SHE IS LEAVING TOWARD THE END OF JULY.  I OWE A CHANGE OF CAREER AND LIFE TO HER HELP!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I will reach out to her.  Thanks.  You don't happen to be on a mac do you?</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>NO I AM ON WINDOWS</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>ok, was wondering how my site looked in safari.  it is acting up in Edge.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>OH KEEP IN MIND, BRIAN ASSESSES PROJECTS MAINLY IN CHROME, HE IS NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT OTHER BROWSER TYPES</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>My project is a tool for use on iPads and will be used by at least one JCPS school for running their snackcart (used by developmentally disabled students).  So I hope to test it in Safari at some point.  </p>
            <p>Oh wait, they had to install Chrome on the iPad for the old solution I gave them, so that shouldn't matter.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, EITHER TOMORROW OR EARLY NEXT WEEK...  SEND A NOTE OR SLACK TO CODE LOUISVILLE STAFF: BRIAN, SHANNON, ROBIN AND JOSH.  DESCRIBE YOUR SITUATION AS YOU HAVE DONE WITH ME TODAY...  I AM WILLING TO BET YOU MAY SEE SOME UNEXPECTED ADVICE AND HELP </p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I will thanks for the advice.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>KEEP IN MIND, CODE LOUISVILLE A PROJECT OF A WIDER AGENCY: KETUCKIANA WORKS, DID YOU KNOW THAT?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Yeah, I did.  That's how I got started with it.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>SO CODE LOUISVILLE STAFF HAVE DEEPER POCKETS TO HELP YOU GET AND STAY EMPLOYED.  ALSO, WILL YOU BE IN NEXT THURSDAY? I'D LIKE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I am normally in the Wednesday session.  Next week I was planning to attend the Ionic, React, Angular and IoT meeting on Thursday.  The following week?</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>WHENEVER YOU DO SHOW UP ON THURSDAYS, DON'T LET ME MISS YOU!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I won't.</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>I'M PART OF YOUR NETWORK NOW, DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK AROUND AMONG PEOPLE I KNOW ABOUT JOBS AND HIRING PROCESS??</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>yes please.</p></div>

            <div class="interviewed"><p>https://gabbarddesigns.github.io/snackcart/  https://github.com/GabbardDesigns/snackcart </p>
        <p>Most of my previous work has been proprietary, so none of it is on Git.  I am reworking the css on the snackcart, so it may have some ugly bits.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="interviewer"><p>THAT'S GREAT! I WILL CHECK THAT OUT TOO. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON TRACK?</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>I think I am on track.  33 custom JS functions | 620 lines of mostly dry CSS</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>WOW! I SEE IT IS RESPONSIVE TOO!</p></div>
            <div class="interviewed"><p>Yeah, get too small in landscape and it tells you to turn to portrait.  I didn't feel like doing a complete redesign for a 4th breakpoint. (edited)  The modal i just added and have not styled yet.  There are two: If you edit and order, and click the pale *new order* button  or if you complete and order</p></div>
            
            <div class="interviewer"><p>OK THANK YOU SIR, I'M GOING TO AFK FOR A WHILE BUT I'LL STILL MONITOR SLACK, GOT SOME THINKING TO DO.</p></div>
